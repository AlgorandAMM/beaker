## TODOs

### house keeping

- Make it easier to install 

- Documentation

- Testing

- Better detection of type errors

### features

- Class mix-in type functionality (i.e. `class MyApp(ARC18):` adds methods and global/local state requirements for ARC18)

- Provide `companion` application to be the receiver of op-up requests and trampoline-ing for funding during create

- Add box state interface (take into account that callers need to know what box names they'll need access to)


What else? File Issues!
